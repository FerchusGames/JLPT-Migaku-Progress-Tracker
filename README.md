# migaku-memory-jlpt-n1-progress-tracker

A small Python tool that visualizes your Japanese vocabulary progress using data from [SirOlaf/migaku-anki-exporter](https://github.com/SirOlaf/migaku-anki-exporter).  

It compares your exported Migaku wordlists with a JLPT vocabulary file and shows how many words you know, are learning, or havenâ€™t learned yet.

## Features

â€¢ Shows your JLPT vocabulary progress as a pie chart.  
â€¢ Copies the a list of unknown words to your clipboard for quick review with Migaku Clipboard (Great for generating AI sentence cards when you havenâ€™t hit your daily quota).
â€¢ Treats words in `ignored.csv` as known.  
â€¢ Automatically installs required libraries if missing.  
â€¢ Exports all unknown JLPT words to `unknown_words.csv`.  
â€¢ Aborts if a required file is missing.

## Installation

### 1. Install the Migaku Anki Exporter

You must have [SirOlaf/migaku-anki-exporter](https://github.com/SirOlaf/migaku-anki-exporter) installed and configured.  
This exporter generates the `known.csv`, `learning.csv`, and `ignored.csv` files that this tracker uses.  
Follow the setup instructions on that repository before running this tool.

### 2. Download the tracker

Download and extract your desired JLPT Level [Progress Tracker.zip](https://github.com/FerchusGames/migaku-memory-jlpt-n1-progress-tracker/releases/tag/Release).

## Usage

Export your Migaku wordlists using [SirOlaf/migaku-anki-exporter](https://github.com/SirOlaf/migaku-anki-exporter) and place them inside the `wordlists/` folder.

Run the script from your terminal:

```
python app.py
```

It will:
- Install the necessary libraries.
- Check that the required files exist.  
- Generate a pie chart (`progress_chart.png`).  
- Save your unknown words to `unknown_words.csv`.  
- Copy the first 500 unknown words to your clipboard. 

Example output:

```
ðŸ“‹ First 500 unknown words copied to clipboard (out of 3765 total).
âœ… Total JLPT words: 8127
Known (including Ignored): 4048
Learning: 314
Unknown: 3765
Unknown words saved to: unknown_words.csv
Chart saved to: progress_chart.png
```
